- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about applied math, scientific computing, glaciers, and anything else!
- ðŸ“– I wrote a [book about using PETSc for fast numerical solutions of partial differential equations](https://my.siam.org/Store/Product/viewproduct/?ProductId=32850137).  My book has C/PETSc and Python/Firedrake examples [at the p4pdes repo here](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes).
- Try out the [Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM)](https://github.com/pism/pism) or [Stokes solvers for glaciers tutorial](https://github.com/bueler/stokes-ice-tutorial) or [Stefano's adaptive mesh refinement library for variational inequalities](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/viamr)!
- In Fall 2025 I am teaching an undergraduate course in [real analysis](https://bueler.github.io/real/) and a graduate course in [numerical linear algebra](https://bueler.github.io/nla/)
