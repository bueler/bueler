- 💬 Ask me about applied math, scientific computing, glaciers, and anything else!
- 📖 I wrote a [book about using PETSc for fast numerical solutions of partial differential equations](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/book/10.1137/1.9781611976311).  My book has C/PETSc and Python/Firedrake examples [at my p4pdes repo](https://github.com/bueler/p4pdes).
- Check out the [Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM)](https://github.com/pism/pism) or [a tutorial on Stokes solvers for glaciers](https://github.com/bueler/stokes-ice-tutorial) or [Stefano's adaptive mesh refinement library for variational inequalities](https://github.com/StefanoFochesatto/viamr)!
- In Fall 2025 I am teaching an undergraduate course in [real analysis](https://bueler.github.io/real/) and a graduate course in [numerical linear algebra](https://bueler.github.io/nla/)
